Differences from STM32 assmebly codes

1. Instead of using "Mem_Addr=0x20000040", use "Mem_Addr equ 0x20000040"
2. Labels should not have ":" 
3. Instead of using "End B End", use "end" to end the program
4. Comments will be represented by ";" instead of "//"

When an error occurs in the code, the simulator informs about possible ways to correct it.
